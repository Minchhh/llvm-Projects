Attached test case in the Testcase folder has a struct defined in define.h, this is used across multiple functions in main.c and fill.c. 

The task is to write a pass in llvm to determine the following,

    - Dead fields of the struct - the fields which are not accessed at all / the fields to which there is only store (no load access) / fields accessed in functions which are not called anywhere 
    -  Hot fields - Fields which are frequently accessed, for example fields used in loops.
    - Cold fields - Fields which are less frequently accessed. 

This can be implemented by assigning weight to each field of the structure. When you encounter an access to any field of a  structure,
  -  increment weight of the field by 1 if it is not in any loop
  -  if it is in loop increment by value equal to 8^(depth of loop). 

To get single IR file from different source files use below command
$clang -S -emit-llvm main.c
$clang -S -emit-llvm fill.c
$llvm-link main.ll fill.ll -S -o out.ll
