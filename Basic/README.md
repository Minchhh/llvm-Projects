The above code is implemented to Identify and print the following 

    • Number of Basic Blocks 
    • Number of Instructions in each basic block 
    • Basic block with max instructions 
    • Basic Block with 2+ successors & predecessors 
    • Basic Block with Max successors & predecessors

The testcase files used are Selection_sort.c, fact.c, array.c, pattern.c which are in Testcase folder.

The .ll files are generated by using the below command

    • clang array.c -emit-llvm -S 

where array.c is the file name used.

The code implemented is in the hello pass of llvm and the command used is 

    • ~/llvm/build/bin/opt array.ll --load ~/llvm/build/lib/LLVMHello.so -enable-new-pm=0 -hello -S -o out.ll
    
where array.ll is the input .ll file which is used to run the hello pass and out.ll is the output file generated.
