SCEV Assignment is as follows

c = 10;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
  A[i+2] = c+i+2
  A[i+1] = c+i+1;
  A[i+3] = c+i+3;
  A[i] = c+i;
}

This code is simd vectorized if the array accesses are in order. That is 0/1/2/3.

1. For the above access pattern , identify that the accesses are not in required order .

2 .Rearrange the code to make the access in required order.
